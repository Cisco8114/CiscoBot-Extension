# FaxStore Invoices
This is a command that you can put into `/src/commands/slash` in your Dark Bot folder. This will allow you to create an invoice directly from Dark Bot!

This extension uses the FaxStore extension [Invoice API](https://github.com/FAXES/faxstore-extensions/tree/main/Invoice%20API).

This file does **NOT** go in the `extensions` folder!
